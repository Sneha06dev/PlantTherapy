## Usage

PlantTherapy relies on the Gemini AI API provided by Google to deliver accurate plant-related information. Here is how to use the platform:

**API Key Setup**: Obtain your Gemini AI API key from the [Google Developers website](https://developers.google.com). Add your API key to the environment variables:
    ```bash
    API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

## API Testing

Before integrating the Gemini API into PlantTherapy, we tested the API key using Postman to ensure it was accepting POST requests correctly. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Set Up Postman**:
   - Open Postman and create a new POST request.
   - In the URL field, enter the Gemini API endpoint provided by Google.

2. **Add Headers**:
   - Add the required headers, such as `Content-Type: application/json` and `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here`.

3. **Send a Request**:
   - Construct the body of your request with the necessary parameters and data.
   - Send the request and check the response to verify that the API key is working correctly.

This step is significant as it ensures that the API integration will function smoothly within the PlantTherapy platform.
